The purpose of this project is to utilize R and run a word-processing program to simulate how 
YouTube runs its video recommending process as well as identify which keywords may be
associated with certain genres/categories of videos to better display titles for videos to both new
and old content creators to gather more views and expand their channel. By utilizing certain 
keywords within the title of your videos and based on keywords that are used in videos you 
watch, you should receive recommendations with similar words/categories. This process doesnâ€™t 
seem to have been taken on by anyone and is uniquely focusing on text/word processing whereas
there has been an instance which utilized running YouTubes API algorithm with videos instead of text.
